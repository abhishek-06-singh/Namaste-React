## Coding Assignment:

- Build a `Food Ordering App`
  - Think of a `cool name` for your app
  - Build an `AppLayout`
  - Build a `Header Component` with `Logo` & `Nav Items` & `Cart`
  - Build a `Body Component`
    - Build `RestaurantList Component`
    - Build `RestaurantCard Component`
      - Use `static data initially`
      - Make your `card dynamic`(pass in props)
        - `Props` - passing arguments to a function - `Use Destructuring` & `Spread operator`
      - `Render` your cards with `dynamic data of restaurants`
      - Use `Array.map` to render all the restaurants

### PS. Basically do everything that I did in the class, in the `same sequence`. `Don't skip small things`.
