- What is Emmet ?
  Emmet is a shorthand syntax for writing HTML, CSS, and other markup languages in a faster and more efficient way. It is a plugin or extension that can be used in code editors, such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom, to generate code snippets with just a few keystrokes.

Emmet uses abbreviations or shortcuts to generate code snippets. For example, typing ul>li\*3 and then pressing the Tab key will expand the abbreviation to:

```html
<ul>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
```
