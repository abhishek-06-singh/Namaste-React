## What is Emmet ?

Emmet is a shorthand syntax for writing HTML, CSS, and other markup languages in a faster and more efficient way. It is a plugin or extension that can be used in code editors, such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom, to generate code snippets with just a few keystrokes.

Emmet uses abbreviations or shortcuts to generate code snippets. For example, typing ul>li\*3 and then pressing the Tab key will expand the abbreviation to:

```html
<ul>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
```

Similarly, typing div.container>h1.title+p and pressing Tab will expand to:

```html
<div class="container">
  <h1 class="title"></h1>
  <p></p>
</div>
```

Emmet supports a wide range of abbreviations for HTML tags, CSS properties, and more. It can also perform calculations, such as adding and subtracting numbers, and includes features like auto-completion and nested actions.

Using Emmet can significantly speed up the process of writing markup and reduce the risk of errors, making it a popular tool among web developers.

## Difference between libraries and frameworks ?

Both libraries and frameworks are tools used in software development, but they have different roles and characteristics.

- A library is a collection of pre-written code that can be used to perform specific tasks or functions. It usually consists of a set of functions, methods, and classes that are designed to be used in various programming contexts. Developers can choose to use a library in their code by calling its functions or methods, but they have more control over the flow of their code.

- On the other hand, a framework is a more comprehensive set of pre-written code that provides a structure or template for building applications. It includes a set of rules, guidelines, and conventions that developers must follow when building their applications.

In the context of JavaScript and React development, a library is a set of pre-written code that provides functionality for a specific task or feature. For example, React is a library for building user interfaces. Developers can use React by importing its components and using them to build their UI.
On the other hand, a framework like Next.js provides a more comprehensive set of pre-written code that provides a structure and set of conventions for building React applications. Next.js provides a set of features like server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and route prefetching that help developers build performant and scalable React applications.
The main difference between a library and a framework in the context of React development is that a library provides specific functionality that can be used in a flexible manner, while a framework provides a more structured and opinionated approach to building applications.

Some other popular React libraries include Redux for managing application state and Axios for making HTTP requests. Some popular React frameworks include Next.js and Gatsby.js for building static and server-rendered React applications.
